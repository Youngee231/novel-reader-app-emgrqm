Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Home Screen/Dashboard:** A visually appealing home screen that displays a curated list of novels (initially from a local data source). This screen will have a modern design with smooth animations.\n*   **Repository Integration:** Implement the ability to add GitHub and GitLab repositories. This will involve a form where users can input repository URLs.\n*   **Novel Reading Screen:** A dedicated screen for reading novels, with options for adjusting font size, theme (light/dark), and triggering translations.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f5f5f5` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#6200ee` (Purple, for main interactive elements)\n    *   Secondary: `#03dac6` (Teal, as an accent color)\n    *   Accent: `#bb86fc` (Light purple, for highlights)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White, for cards and containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#ff4081` (Pink, for important highlights)\n*   **Typography:** Use \"System\" font for a modern and clean look.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Create UI stubs:** Create the basic UI structure for the home screen, repository addition form, and novel reading screen.\n2.  **Implement repository addition:** Implement the functionality to add GitHub and GitLab repositories.\n3.  **Implement novel reading screen:** Implement the novel reading screen with basic text display and formatting options.\n4.  **Remove demo content:** Remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n\nNow, I'll instruct the coding agent to implement this plan. After the implementation, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-26T15:50:23.843934"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a modern novel reading app with GitHub/GitLab integration and translation capabilities.
